      Total greenhouse gas emissions in {{ settings.area_name }} was <strong>{{ present.total_energetic_and_non_energetic_co2_emissions | round: 1 | autoscale: 'T' }}</strong> in {{ settings.start_year }}} In Paris, we agreed to reduce these greenhouse gas emissions by 95% by 2050 and the National Climate Agreement will be -49% by 2030. Of these greenhouse gas emissions, <strong>{{present.non_energetic_co2_emissions_percentage | times: 100 | round: 1}}%</strong> non-energetic, so is not the result of the energy system. Non-energy greenhouse gas emissions include methane from cows, cooling gases in the food industry or N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from fertilizer use. These non-energy emissions have fallen considerably nationally since 1990. The approach to this is important, but it is different from the approach via the energy system. The Energy Transition Model focuses only on the energy system of {{ settings.area_name }}.

    <h1 class="banner">2. Energy demand</h1>

    <p>
    Reducing CO<sub>2</sub>emissions can be reduced by reducing fossil energy demand. This energy demand is a sum of many loose developments. Both an increase or decrease and a change in demand can play at the same time. For example, the changing population size (from <strong>{{ present.households_number_of_inhabitants | round: 1 | autoscale: 'M' }} million</strong> to <strong>{{ future.households_number_of_inhabitants | round: 1 | autoscale: 'M' }} million</strong>), more homes and/or more transport increase in energy demand. On the other hand, at the same time, savings such as insulation and growing efficiencies are once again reducing energy demand. Finally, technology changes sometimes change demand, both in volume and in type of energy carrier. For example, with a heat pump or electric car there is no longer a direct demand for natural gas, but for electricity. The energy carrier has changed from gas to electricity. In these cases, the technologies are often more efficient, reducing volume. </p>


    <h2 class="banner">A. Built Environment</h2>
    <p>
    This chapter takes you through the future energy demand of the built environment in the scenario created, these are households (=dwellings) and other buildings. Other buildings are all concerned with a roof that is not a home or heavy industry. These are secondary schools, hospitals, town halls and company offices. Both the volume (annual energy demand) and the necessary energy carrier (gas, electricity, heat, hydrogen, biomass, etc...) are discussed.  On the basis of the two question functions Power and Light and Low temperature heat, the future energy needs will be explained.
    </p>

    <h3 class="banner">A1. Power and Light</h3>
    <p>
    The electricity demand of appliances and lighting is covered by Force and Light.</p>
    <p> The demand for Power and Light in households is in {{ settings.start_year }} <strong>{{ present.households_final_demand_power_and_light | autoscale: 'MJ' }}</strong> and <strong>{{{present.households_final_demand_power_and_light_percentage | times: 100 | round: 1}}%</strong> of total current energy demand in households. An interplay of the assumptions for demographics, per capita use and technology (e.g. LED, light bulb or halogen) influence future demand. In {{ settings.end_year }} this is total <strong>{{ future.households_final_demand_power_and_light | autoscale: 'MJ' }}</strong> en <strong>{{future.households_final_demand_power_and_light_percentage | times: 100 | round: 1}}%</strong> of total energy demand in households. Below you can see the development of energy demand as a result of the assumptions in the scenario.

An interplay of the assumptions for number of buildings, efficiencies and technology choices (e.g. LED, light bulb or halogen) lead to future demand. In {{ settings.end_year}} this is total <strong>{{ future.buildings_final_demand_power_and_light | autoscale: 'MJ' }}</strong> en <strong>{{future.buildings_final_demand_power_and_light_percentage | times: 100 | round: 1}}%</strong> of total energy demand in buildings.

    </p>
    <h4 class="banner">Demand Development</h4>
    <p>
    In the scenario created, the following assumptions were made about the development of the housing stock and the effects of insulation.

    <h4 class="banner"1>Implementation technology</h4>
    <p> A choice for another technology to heat the house, water or food can cause a change in volume, but also a change in demand. The change in volume is because a technology is more or less efficient. For example, a heat pump is more efficient than a boiler. The change in type-demand comes when a technology otherwise makes heat, such as a boiler gas and a wood-burning stove. Below you can see the change in demand in volume and energy carrier for first households and then buildings.

    <h2 class="banner">B. Mobility and Transport</h2>
    <p>
    Energy use for mobility and transport can be divided into passenger transport, freight transport and international transport (of goods and persons). Below you can see how they relate to each other. Because international transport is not officially part of national energy use, this energy use can only be seen if the scenario has chosen to make it count.

    <h3 class="banner">B1. Passenger transport</h3>
    <h4 class="banner">Demand Development</h4>
    <p>
    The scenario made the following assumptions about the development of energy demand for passenger transport. These are due to choices for change in <i>mobility</i> (how much we travel), <i>modality</i> (whether we're traveling by car, bike the train) and the <i>technology</i> (electric or petrol cars). Finally, these technologies can each become even more efficient.

    <h4 class="banner">Demand Development</h4>
    <p>
         	The scenario made the following assumptions about the development of energy demand for freight transport. These are due to choices for change in <i>volume</i> (how much we transport), <i>modality</i> (whether we do the truck, train or barge) and the <i>technology</i> (hydrogen or diesel trucks). Finally, these technologies can each become even more efficient.

    <h2 class="banner">C. Industrie</h2>
    <p> Below you can see the energy demand of the industrial sectors. The width of each column indicates how much energy it uses. The energy carriers are used for Power and Light and a Warmth. This graph does not include the use of energy carriers as raw materials (non-energetic). Sectors such as Chemistry, Refineries, Fertilizer and Metal sector often have high temperature heat demand. To reach these temperatures it is usually necessary to burn something (natural gas, green gas, hydrogen or biomass for example). The other sectors are more likely to have a demand for lower temperature heat that can be filled more make-up by sustainable alteratieven.

    <h1 class="banner">3. Matching supply and demand</h1>
    <p> Of course, all the energy demand from the sectors has to come from somewhere. Below we look at the implementation of electricity, heat grids, hydrogen, biomass and possibly still present fossil sources.
    </p>

    <h2 class="banner">A. Electricity</h2>
    <h3> A1. Supply and demand (annual)</h3>
    <p>
    Of course, electricity has to come from somewhere. Most electricity in your scenario is produced with {{ future.biggest_electricity_producer_name | i18n: 'output_element_series' }} ({{ future.biggest_electricity_producer_value | autoscale: 'MJ'}}}} The red line is the annual volume of electricity needed in the scenario. It may be that a lot of imports (dark blue) are needed while enough electricity is generated every year (more than). The ETM calculates supply and demand of electricity on an hourly basis. This scenario has volume <strong>{{future.imported_electricity_percentage| times: 100 | round: 1}}%</strong> electricity import. In addition, the current in this scenario <strong>{{ future.dashboard_blackout_hours | without_unit }}</strong> hours out and is {{ settings.area_name}} for <strong>{{future.dashboard_security_of_supply}}</strong> hours depending on imports. Flexibility options such as battery storage, hydrogen or smart handling of demand can help to reduce surpluses and imports.

    <h3> A2. Electricity market and Flexibility (hourly basis)</h3>

    {% if settings.merit_order_enabled %}
    <h4>Merit order and fuel prices</h4>

    <p>
    The electricity market is organized according to the so-called <i>merit order</i> of electricity production.
    			Deze sorteert regelbare elektriciteitscentrales op <i>marginale kosten</i> (de kosten van het produceren
    			van een extra MWh elektriciteit).
           		Wind, zon-PV en must-run WKK hebben effectief marginale kosten van 0 €/MWh.
    The chart below shows marginal costs and installed power of electricity production in
    your scenario.
    </p>

    {% chart 125 %}
    Merit order and marginal costs in {{ settings.end_year }}.
    {% endchart %}

    <p>
    Depending on the question at any time in the year, the merit order determines which power stations run and which are not.
    			De goedkoopste mogen eerst leveren, daarna de eerstvolgende in marginale kosten, etc. Wind en zon-PV gaan dus
    			altijd voor, terwijl
    low marginal power plants such as nuclear power plants usually provide base load. Power plants with higher
    marginal costs, after all, catch the spikes in demand.
    </p>

    <p>
    Marginal costs for power plants are mainly determined by fuel prices. By the
    price of coal or CO<sub>2</sub> to be boosted in ETM, gas-fired power plants can be more competitive
    coal-fired power stations, for example.
    </p>

    	<h4>Electricity surpluses</h4>

    	<p>
    			Het scenario heeft <strong>{{future.dashboard_total_number_of_excess_events }}</strong> uren overschotten,
    			van de totale <strong> 8,760 </strong> uren die er totaal in een jaar zitten. Hieronder zie je wat er
    			gebeurt met de overschotten.

    			{% chart 163 %}
    	An overview of the surpluses of electricity and how it is used in the scenario in {{ settings.end_year }}.
    	{% endchart %}


    <h4> Profitability </h4>

    <p>
    Reliability of (electricity) supply and the profitability of power plants are directly linked.
    Dispatchble power plants make a profit when they have a lot of turning hours, preferably at times when electricity prices
    			hoog is.
    However, a reliable electricity system needs backup power plants to absorb extreme peaks
    			maar een paar keer per jaar optreden. Die centrales hebben dus typisch weinig draaiuren.
    </p>

    	<!-- Unprofitable plants -->
    	        	{% if future.profitability_percentage < 100 %}

    	<p>
    	In this scenario{ {{ 100 | minus: future.profitability_percentage | round: 1 }}% of the power plants are loss-making.
    	This means that they do not recoup their investments (CAPEX) (orange in the table below)
    	or even do not cover their turning costs (OPEX) (red).
    	            	{% chart 140 %}

    	            	{% endchart %}

    	It is not expected that loss-making plants will remain open for a long time unless the electricity market
    				hervormd wordt met een capaciteitsvergoeding bijvoorbeeld. Om winstgevendheid te verbeteren kan men:
    	<ul>
    	<li><strong>Increasing electricity demand</strong>: by giving power plants more turning hours you can increase their profitability
    	improve.</li>
    	<li><strong>Competitive production reduction</strong>: electricity from wind and sun PV has no marginal costs,
    	as a result, conventional (dispatchable) plants from the market are 'printed'.</li>
    	<li><strong>Closing power stations</strong>: this increases the realism of the scenario and can cost the system
    	lower.</li>
    	</ul>

            	<h4> Delivery Certainty </h4>

            	<p>
              	The 'loss of load expectation' (LOLE) is the expected number of hours per year
              	electricity demand cannot be met with the production capacity drawn up.
              	A LOLE larger than zero does not directly mean that the light goes out because electricity can be
              	imported or can be removed from batteries. In the Netherlands, a LOLE of 4 u/j
              	deemed acceptable.
            	</p>

            	<p>
              	Your scenario says {{ future.dispatchable_electricity_production_capacity | autoscale: 'MW' }}

              	{{ future.dashboard_security_of_supply | without_unit }} hour 'loss of load' per year.
            	</p>

    			<p>

              	Like LOLE, the number of blackout hours is a measure of the reliability of your electricity system.

    <h2>Appendix C: About the Energy Transition Model</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>
    The <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com" target="_blank">Energyietransition model (ETM)</a>
    a free, open-source, web-based
    energy model to explore energy scenarios for the future.
    </p>

    <p>
    The ETM is for anyone who wants to explore and create energy scenarios for countries, cities,
    neighborhoods and even streets.
    No prior knowledge is assumed so that the ETM can be used by both experts and students.
    You can make assumptions about supply and demand of different types of energy from source to
    Application. Etm determines sustainability, reliability for all stakeholders in the sustainability, reliability system
    affordability at national and local level.
    </p>

    <p>
    Op
    <a href="http://www.energierekenmodels.co.uk" target="_blank">energy computing models.nl</a> you can see how etm is
    compares to other models.
    </p>


    <h3>Scope of the Energy Transition Model</h3>

    <blockquote>
    <p>
    All models are wrong but some are useful.<br/>
    <em>~ George Box</em>
    </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Although Quintel tries to bring all the important features of the energy system, the ETM has necessarily
    limited scope and should not be used as a replacement for critical thinking. Contrary! Hopefully, the
    user inspired to think more deeply about the results and limits of the model!
    </p>

    <p>
    The following (very) incomplete list of topics is indicative of the limits of the ETM:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Human behavior</strong>: undoubtedly the biggest impact on the success or failure of the
    energy transition is outside the scope of the mainly technical/financial ETM.</li>
    <li><strong>Economic connections</strong>: ETM calculates costs based on published current values and takes
    no price elasticity or other economic relations that may no longer apply in the future.</li>
    <li><strong>Legislation</strong>: etm calculates costs without subsidies or taxes.</li>
    </ul>
