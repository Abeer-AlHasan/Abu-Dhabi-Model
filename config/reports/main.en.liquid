<h1 class="banner">Introduction</h1>

<p>
This is an automatically generated report based on the choices made in your scenario.
<br>
Each chapter in this report highlights an important result such as CO2 emissions, cost,
renewability etc. which correspond to the dashboard items of the ETM.
<br>
Following the dashboard-chapters, the report contains a chapter with suggestions for 
improving the scenario and a chapter with implications for the years leading up to
the end-year.
<br>
Finally, an appendix lists all the sliders changed from their default value.

<h1 class="banner">Energy use</h1>

<h2>Energy consumption</h2>

{% chart 146 %}
  Final energy demand for all sectors.
{% endchart %}

<h2>Electricity production</h2>


{% chart 99 %}
  Electricity mix.
{% endchart %}

<p>
  In your scenario, wind turbines and solar arrays are producing
  {{ future.electricity_produced_from_wind_and_solar | autoscale: 'MJ'}} of electricity, while
  coal and natural gas are being used to create
  {{ future.electricity_produced_from_coal | autoscale: 'MJ'}} and
  {{ future.electricity_produced_from_natural_gas | autoscale: 'MJ'}} respecively.
</p>

<h2>Central heat network</h2>

The central heat network in your scenario can be used to heat houses and buildings and provide heat
to the industry and agricultural sectors. The chart below show the balance of heat produced and 
consumed centrally.

{% chart 174 %}
  Heat balance of central heat network.
{% endchart %}

{% if future.energy_heat_network_unused_steam_hot_water_in_heat_network_mekko > 0.0 %}
  <p>
  There is 
  {{ future.energy_heat_network_unused_steam_hot_water_in_heat_network_mekko | autoscale: 'PJ'}} 
  excess heat produced in agriculture or industry which flows back into the central heat
  network but is not used by other sectors. 
  </p>
{% else %}
  <p>
  There is 
  {{ future.energy_heat_network_backup_heater_network_gas_in_heat_network_mekko | autoscale: 'PJ'}}
  insufficient heat produced to satisfy the demand of the central heat network. A backup
  gas heater is deployed to satisfy the deficit.
  </p>

<h1 class="banner">CO2 Emissions (-{{ future.co2_reduction_percentage | round: 1 | without_unit }}%)</h1>

{% chart 46 %}
  CO2 emissions based on primary energy demand for 1990 (left), {{ settings.start_year }} (middle), 
  and {{ settings.end_year }} (right). These figures represent emissions across the complete fuel chain
  including all transformations and losses.
{% endchart %}

<!-- Supports else, elsif, and unless. -->
{% if future.co2_reduction_percentage > 40.0 %}
  <p>
    The reduction of {{ future.co2_reduction_percentage | round: 1 | without_unit }} exceeds the
    Dutch national ambition for 2030 of 40%.

  {% if future.co2_reduction_percentage > 80.0 %}
    Your scenario even surpasses the goal of 80% - 95% reduction aimed for by the EU for 2050!
  {% endif %}
  </p>
{% else %}

    In your scenario, CO2 emission reductions fall short of the Dutch ambitions of 40% in 2030 
    and 80% - 95% in 2050. You can reduce CO2 by 
    <ul>
      <li>Realising energy savings: reduce energy consumption in the most energy-intensive sectors</li>
      <li>Phasing out fossil fuels: heating and hot water in homes, transportation and electricity 
        production are places where fossil fuels can be replaced by CO2-neutral alternatives.</li>
      <li>CCS(U): Capturing, storing and, optionally, using CO2 can be viable options in the 
        energy-intensive industry and electricity generation (energy) sector.</li>
      <li>Flexibility: storage and conversion technologies enable you to utilise energy which would
      otherwise be exported or curtailed.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
{% endif %}

<h2>On-the-spot CO2 emissions</h2>

<p>
 The Sankey digram below shows 
 <strong>which</strong> carriers are primarily responsible for CO2 emissions (left column) and 
 <strong>where</strong> in the system CO2 is emitted (centre column). 
</p>

{% chart 191 %}
  Sankey diagram showing which carriers and sectors are primarily responsible for CO2 emissions.
{% endchart %}

<h1 class="banner">Energy import and export</h1>

{% chart 76 %}
  Import and export of energy.
{% endchart %}


{% if future.total_number_of_excess_events > 1.0 %}
  <h2>Flexibility</h2>

    <p>You created a scenario where for {{ future.total_number_of_excess_events | without_unit }} 
      hours in the year, (renewable and must-run) electricity production exceeds demand.
    </p>

  {% chart 175 %}
    Histogram showing number and duration of excess events.
  {% endchart %}

{% endif %}


<h1 class="banner">Reliability and black-outs</h1>

<h2>LOLE and black-outs</h2>

{% chart 111 %}
  Import and export of energy.
{% endchart %}



<h1 class="banner">Cost and employment</h1>
<h2>Cost of the energy system</h2>

<!-- Round the query value to 2dp -->
<p>
  Electricity production costs:
  {{ future.costs_of_used_electricity | autoscale: 'euro' }}.
</p>

{% if settings.merit_order_enabled %}
  <h2>Merit order and profitability of power plants</h2>


  {% chart 125 %}
    Merit order.
  {% endchart %}

  <!-- {% chart 140 %}
    Profitability of power plants.
  {% endchart %} -->

{% endif %}
<h1 class="banner">Bio-footprint and renewability</h1>

<h2>Bio-footprint</h2>
<p>
In your scenario, {{ future.bio_footprint | round: 1 }} times the available areable land is used for
the production of bio-fuels such as wood, ethanol, bio-gas and bio-diesel.
</p>

<h2>Renewability</h2>

{% chart 49 %}
  Renewability percentage of final energy demand.
{% endchart %}

<h1 class="banner">Suggestions for improvement</h1>
<h2>Possible inconsistencies</h2>

<h3>Refineries and electric vehicles</h3>

<p>
Electric vehicles constitute {{ future.ev_percentage | round: 1 }}% of all cars. 
At the same time, oil refineries are still {{ future.refinery_percentage | round: 1 }}% of
their current size. 

Do you think this is realistic? For an analysis of the correllation between electrification
of transport and the size of the refinery sector see the report
"Industry in Transition" (Quintel Intelligence 2016). 
</p>

<h2>Extreme assumptions</h2>

<h1 class="banner">Implications of this scenario</h1>

<h2>Investments needed</h2>

<p>
  Your scenario spans {{ future:scenario_duration }} year. As a result of the choices 
  you made, we must build the following list of items on average every year
</p>


<ul>
  <li>{{ future:number_of_wind_turbines_per_year | round: 1 }} windturbines</li>
  <li>{{ future:number_of_wind_turbines_per_year }} windturbines</li>
  <li>{{ future:number_of_wind_turbines_per_year }} windturbines</li>
</ul>

<h2>Land-use</h2>

<p>
  Coastal area used by wind:
  {{ future.area_used_for_coastal_wind | round: 2 }} square kilometers
