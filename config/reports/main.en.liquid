<h1 class="banner">Introduction</h1>

<p>
  This is an automatically generated report based on the choices made in your scenario.
</p>
  Each chapter in this report highlights an important result such as CO2 emissions, cost,
  renewability etc. which correspond to the dashboard items of the 
  <a href="https://energytransitionmodel.com">Energy Transition Model.</a> (ETM).
<p>
  Following the dashboard-chapters, the report contains a chapter with suggestions for 
  improving the scenario and a chapter with implications for the years leading up to
  the end-year.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, appendix A lists all the sliders that were changed from their default value.
  Appendix B gives a detailed overview of all investment costs.
  Appendix C provides background information about the Energy Transition Model.

{% if future.primary_energy_demand_percentage_wrt_start_year > 95.0 %}

  <p>
    In your scenario, primary energy use is still 
    {{ future.primary_energy_demand_percentage_wrt_start_year | round: 2 }}% of what it was in the 
    start-year.
  </p>
{% else %}
  <p>
    In your scenario, primary energy use is has been reduced to
    {{ future.primary_energy_demand_percentage_wrt_start_year | round: 2 }}% of what it was in the 
    start-year.
  </p>

{% endif %}


{% if future.co2_reduction_percentage > 40.0 %}
  <p>
    The realised CO2-reduction of {{ future.co2_reduction_percentage | round: 1 | without_unit }}%
    exceeds the Dutch national ambition for 2030 of 40%.

  {% if future.co2_reduction_percentage > 80.0 %}
    Your scenario even surpasses the EU goal of 80% - 95% reduction by 2050!
  {% endif %}
  </p>
{% else %}

<h1 class="banner">Energy use</h1>

<h2>Energy consumption</h2>

The {{ future.biggest_final_demand_sector_name | without_unit }} sector is the largest consumer of energy
with {{ future.biggest_final_demand_sector_value | autoscale: 'MJ'}} of final demand.

{% chart 146 %}
  Final energy demand for all sectors.
{% endchart %}

When it comes to <strong>primary</strong> demand (final demand plus all transformation and distribution losses),
the energy use for the whole system looks like this: 

{% chart 52 %}
  Primary energy demand for all sectors.
{% endchart %}

When looking at primary demand, exported oil(products) can play a big role if refeneries are still producing
at a significant rate.

<h2>Electricity production</h2>

<p>
  In your scenario, wind turbines and solar arrays are producing
  {{ future.electricity_produced_from_wind_and_solar | autoscale: 'MJ'}} of electricity, while
  coal and natural gas are being used to create
  {{ future.electricity_produced_from_coal | autoscale: 'MJ'}} and
  {{ future.electricity_produced_from_natural_gas | autoscale: 'MJ'}} respecively.
</p>

{% chart 99 %}
  Electricity mix.
{% endchart %}

<h2>Central heat network</h2>

The central heat network in your scenario can be used to heat houses and buildings and provide heat
to the industry and agricultural sectors. The chart below show the balance of heat produced and 
consumed centrally.

{% chart 174 %}
  Heat balance of central heat network.
{% endchart %}

{% if future.energy_heat_network_unused_steam_hot_water_in_heat_network_mekko > 0.0 %}
  <p>
  There is 
  {{ future.energy_heat_network_unused_steam_hot_water_in_heat_network_mekko | autoscale: 'PJ'}} 
  excess heat produced in agriculture or industry which flows back into the central heat
  network but is not used by other sectors. 
  </p>
{% else %}
  <p>
  There is 
  {{ future.energy_heat_network_backup_heater_network_gas_in_heat_network_mekko | autoscale: 'PJ'}}
  insufficient heat produced to satisfy the demand of the central heat network. A backup
  gas heater is deployed to satisfy the deficit.
  </p>
{% endif %}

<h1 class="banner">CO2 Emissions ({{ future.co2_reduction_percentage | round: 1 | without_unit }}% reduction achieved)</h1>

{% chart 46 %}
  CO2 emissions based on primary energy demand for 1990 (left), {{ settings.start_year }} (middle), 
  and {{ settings.end_year }} (right). These figures represent emissions across the complete fuel chain
  including all transformations and losses.
{% endchart %}

<!-- Supports else, elsif, and unless. -->
{% if future.co2_reduction_percentage > 40.0 %}
  <p>
    The reduction of {{ future.co2_reduction_percentage | round: 1 | without_unit }} exceeds the
    Dutch national ambition for 2030 of 40%.

  {% if future.co2_reduction_percentage > 80.0 %}
    Your scenario even surpasses the goal of 80% - 95% reduction aimed for by the EU for 2050!
  {% endif %}
  </p>
{% else %}

    In your scenario, CO2 emission reductions fall short of the Dutch ambitions of 40% in 2030 
    and 80% - 95% in 2050. You can reduce CO2 by 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Realising energy savings</strong>: reduce energy consumption in the most energy-intensive sectors</li>
      <li><strong>Phasing out fossil fuels</strong>: heating and hot water in homes, transportation and electricity 
        production are places where fossil fuels can be replaced by CO2-neutral alternatives.</li>
      <li><strong>CCS(U)</strong>: Capturing, storing and, optionally, using CO2 can be viable options in the 
        energy-intensive industry and electricity generation (energy) sector.</li>
      <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: storage and conversion technologies enable you to utilise energy which would
      otherwise be exported or curtailed.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
{% endif %}

<h2>On-the-spot CO2 emissions</h2>

<p>
 The Sankey digram below shows 
 <strong>which</strong> carriers are primarily responsible for CO2 emissions (left column) and 
 <strong>where</strong> in the system CO2 is emitted (centre column). 
</p>

{% chart 191 %}
  Sankey diagram showing which carriers and sectors are primarily responsible for CO2 emissions.
{% endchart %}

<h2>CO2 emissions of biomass</h2>

<p>
Climate change is not induced by the annual CO2 emissions, but by the total amount of CO2 present
 in the air. 
</p>
<p>
Usually no CO2 emissions are attributed to biomass as biomass absorbs as much CO2 as is emitted 
during combustion (over the complete life cycle). The CO2 emitted by combustion of biomass is 
not always absorbed within a time-scale that is relevant for climate change.
</p>

{% chart 188 %}
  Which part of the CO2 emissions from biomass is relevant to the environment is uncertain and 
  speculative. This chart serves to explore the (potential) amount of these emissions. 
{% endchart %}

<h1 class="banner">Energy import and export</h1>

{% if future.total_net_energy_import > 0.0 %}
  <p>
    Your scenario has {{ future.total_net_energy_import | round: 3 | autoscale: 'MJ'}} of net energy import 
    in the end-year.
  </p>
{% else %}
  <p>
    Your scenario has -{{ future.total_net_energy_import | round: 1 | autoscale: 'MJ'}} of net energy export 
    in the end-year.

{% if future.total_number_of_excess_events > 1.0 %}
  <h2>Flexibility</h2>

    <p>You created a scenario where for {{ future.total_number_of_excess_events | without_unit }} 
      hours in the year, (renewable and must-run) electricity production exceeds demand.
    </p>

  {% chart 175 %}
    Histogram showing number and duration of excess events.
  {% endchart %}

{% endif %}


<h1 class="banner">Reliability and black-outs</h1>

<h2>LOLE and black-outs</h2>


<p>
  The loss of load expectation (LOLE) is the expected number of hours per year that the electricity
   supply cannot meet its demand. A nonzero LOLE does not necessarily result in blackouts as 
   electricity can be imported or can be available in batteries. The Netherlands accepts a 
   LOLE of 4 h/yr. We distinguish (un)reliable electricity production as volatile electricity 
   producers cannot be relied on at all times.
</p>

{% chart 111 %}
  Reliability of production capacity.
{% endchart %}

{% if future.dashboard_blackout_hours > 1 %}
  <p>
    Your scenario has {{ future.dashboard_blackout_hours | without_unit }} blackout hours.
    Try building more reliable back-up capacity in the electricity production section.
    Note that solar and wind power are intermittent and cannot add reliable electricity at all
    times. 
  </p>
{% else %}
  <p>
    Your scenario has zero blackout hours.
  </p>  
{% endif %}


<h1 class="banner">Cost and employment</h1>
<h2>Cost of the energy system</h2>

<p>
  Costs of the future energy system are roughly 
  {{ future.dashboard_total_costs | autoscale: 'euro' }} and are broken down in the following chart.
</p>


{% chart 48 %}
  Costs of the energy system.
{% endchart %}

<h1 class="banner">Bio-footprint and renewability</h1>

<h2>Bio-footprint</h2>
<p>
  In your scenario, {{ future.bio_footprint | round: 1 }} times the available areable land is used for
  the production of bio-fuels such as wood, ethanol, bio-gas and bio-diesel.

<h2>Investments needed</h2>

<p>
  Your scenario spans {{ future:scenario_duration }} year. As a result of the choices 
  you made, we must build (amongst others) the following list of items on average every year
</p>


<ul>
  <li>{{ future:number_of_wind_turbines_per_year | round: 1 | without_unit }} off-shore windturbines</li>
  <li>{{ future:number_of_wind_turbines_per_year | round: 1 | without_unit }} on-shore windturbines</li>

    <h3>Refineries and electric vehicles</h3>

    <p>
      In your scenario, electric vehicles constitute {{ future.ev_percentage | round: 1 }}% 
      of all cars, yet oil refineries are still {{ future.refinery_percentage | round: 1 }}% 
      of their current size. 

      Do you think this is realistic? For an analysis of the correllation between electrification
      of transport and the size of the refinery sector see the report

    <h3>Size of steel industry and electric vehicles</h3>

      <p>
        Like oil refineries, a large part of the production output of steel plants is currently 
        dedicated to cars. If, self-driving electric vehicles start to replace fossil fuel cars, 
        the number  of cars can be reduced dramatically.

<!-- Inconsistency between heating options and hot water options -->

{% if future.biggest_space_heater_share_name != future.biggest_water_heater_share_name %}

  <h3>Space heating and hot water technologies</h3>
  <p>
    The space heating technologies in your scenario are not consistent with those producing hot
    water. You have chosen to heat most houses with a 
    {{ future.biggest_space_heater_share_name | without_unit }} whereas most of the hot water
    in households is produced by a 
    {{ future.biggest_water_heater_share_name | without_unit }}. The percentages

  <p>
    NOTE: The combi-technology shares (percentages) in the households space heating and hot water 
    sections represent the market share of these technologies. This means that if you choose to 
    use technology A for space heating in 100% of the houses, and technology B for hot water in 
    100% of the households, every household containes one of both A and B.

<!-- If curtailment occors, why not build more flex or industry use of H2? -->
{% if future.electricity_curtailed > 0 %}

  <h2>Unused potential</h2>


  In your scenario, there are 
  {{ future.total_number_of_excess_events }} hours that electricity production exceeds demand.
  This electricity is not used (curtailed). To usefully employ the excess electricity you can

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Store electricity</strong>: in the flexibility section, you can build batteries in homes or 
      indicate how much of ellectric car batteries can be used for storing electricity.</li>
    <li><strong>Convert electricity to gas</strong>: in the flexibility section, you can build power-to-gas plants
      to convert electricity to hydrogen gas.</li>
    <li><strong>Convert electricity to heat</strong>: in the flexibility section, you can build power-to-heat plants
      which generate heat from electricity and store the heat for use in houses.</li>
    <li><strong>Increase interconnectivity</strong>: in the import/export section you can increase the capacity of
      the interconnectors with neighbouring countries.</li>
    <li><strong>Increase demand</strong>: by electrifying for example heating/hot water production in houses
    or transport.</li>

  <p>
    Your scenario has {{ future.share_of_greengas_in_gas_network | times: 100 | round: 1 }}% of greengas mixed into the gas
    network. This requires about {{ future.bio_footprint_of_greengas_km | round: 1 }} square kilometers of areable
    land which is {{ future.bio_footprint_of_greengas_fraction_of_areable_land | round: 1 }} times the available
